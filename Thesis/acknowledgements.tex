\par During my stage at the \itt{Lehrstuhl f\"{u}r Theoretische Elektrotechnik}, several persons have contributed to my work and without their support it would have been impossible for me to complete it. That is why I wish to dedicate this section to recognize their support. 

\par I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the professors of my graduate committee: Prof. Giuseppe Pelosi and Dr. Ing. Stefano Selleri, without whom this marvelous experience may have never happened.

\par I would like to express my deep appreciation to Univ-Prof. Dr. Romanus Dyczij-Edlinger and Dr-Ing. Ortwin Farle, for their guidance, motivation and support during this period.

\par Special thanks to all the employees, researchers and students at the LTE for their courtesy, the pieces of advice and help they gave me, and most of all for the good time spent together.

\par I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my family for encouragement and continuous support given throughout my life.

\par Last but not least I would like to express my appreciation to my sweetheart, Veronica, for her love, patience, support and understanding throughout these difficult and challenging months.
